## Installation 

Clone the repo to your local machine

### Generate SSH key 

replace `muse-sisay` with your Github username. Only used for identification purpose. 

```sh
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ ssh-keygen -f github-musesisay
```

[Github guide](https://docs.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/connecting-to-github-with-ssh/adding-a-new-ssh-key-to-your-github-account)

### Edit ssh config

Add this to your `~/.ssh/config`. Replace IdentityFile with the one you created. This will allow you to push commits with out providing a password.

```text
Host github.com
    IdentityFile ~/.ssh/github-musesisay
    IdentitiesOnly yes
    Port 22
```

### Get Personal Access Token

You can get a "personal access token in GitHub" by going to `Settings->Developer Settings-> Personal Access Tokens->Generate new token`. (select repo scope, or it won't work). # Edit this

#### Save Access Token

Create `ghAccessToken` in `~/.ssh` and place your access token inside `ghAccessToken`. Change permission to 600 so that only your user account has read and write access.  

```sh
$ cd ~/.ssh
$ touch ghAccessToken
$ chmod 600 ghAccessToken
```

## Usage

```sh 
$ gitinit -t token -u muse-sisay -r sampleRepo
```

This will create a `sampleRepo` repository on github.

## TODO 
- [ ] Securely store Access Token

## Disclaimer 
**Your Access Token with appear in your shell history!**
